im all clear going on a year but if youre still feelin generous throw a dolla at me
im all of a sudden not feeling compassionate
im all worn away when all that hopelessly feeling and loving heart is carved out
im allowed to soak in the disgust i feel when i see misogyny accepted as the norm and the continual rise of male voices over female to declare what we should be ok with and how we should just deal
im allowing myself a whole lotta self involvement for now because i feel the need to nurture my body and soul as if i were its loving mother which i guess i sort of am
